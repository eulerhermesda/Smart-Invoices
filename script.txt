Hello everyone,
[Pause]
--Intro to video--
This is a video to present the SmartInvoice PoC that we built at the Digital agency. For more information you can go to ehda.co/insights.

--Intro to experiment--
This prototype was created to test how a smart-contract could handle interactions between a seller and a buyer, and see how all of this could benefit the whole network of companies.
The demo was made in order to show in the company how such a system works, it is not production-ready at all, but we think it does its job as a demo.

--Experiment--
So here is the main interface, I am selecting :
- who I am
- my buyer
- the amount of the invoice
- And when I click "submit" everything is stored on the blockchain.
[Pause]
Now, let's imagine that I am the buyer, I want to inform my seller that I paid him. (In a real application this would be done by a bank or if the payment is done in Ether the transaction would trigger that action). 
[Pause]
So I say who I am, select the seller, and approve the transaction. Easy and simple.
[Pause]
Now, I am the seller, the due date of my invoice is arriving, I want to check whether my Buyer paid me. I go to the 'Alert' page, choose the invoice and ask for an alert.
[Pause]
And now when we go back to the main screen we can see that we have got paid!

--Conclusion--
Ok so this was a demo version to show people the different steps of the process. We are currently working on a business-ready version of that where everything is streamlined, automated and adaptable. We are extremely excited to be able to tell you more about it later. Stay tuned!
